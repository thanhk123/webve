How to add style in contact form 7 to match your design? With the WOW Styler.

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eMYnhXzTaU]
This video is my first Styler intro video and contains quick start and quick style tutorials. How to add a style, match with your website style and add background images.
For deeper handling information and tricks look at the video inside the plugins tutorial section.

<blockquote>Please make sure you read the latest changes and benefits from our <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/cf7-styler/#developers" target="_blank">WP.org changelog</a> to get the most out of the CF7 styling plugin.</blockquote>

= This is the story about how to add style in contact form 7 by our new plugin =
Melanie and Tobias (me) started using CF7 Forms and we asked ourselves how to add style in contact form 7? We did some research on existing styling contact form 7 wordpress plugins like Contact Form 7 Skins, Contact Form 7 Style. Our main goal was to design a contact form and use this design for other forms, starting from a default template or from the scratch.
What we have seen frustrated us. We thought there must be better ways styling contact forms and thus invented an much easier contact form 7 styler.
This is the beginning of the story about how we got the idea of creating a new plugin to add styles in contact form 7.
= How I turned Melanie, an old Contact Form 7 CSS hard coder, into using the WOW Styler for CF7 =

She said
<blockquote>“why do I have to pay for a plugin license or develop one when you can style everything in the browser and then copy the code into page with the CF7 form?”</blockquote>
<strong>And here is why:</strong>

<ul>
 	<li>You need a CSS plugin to add contact form 7 css per page and not to style and have all forms look the same style across the whole website.</li>
 	<li>And you can not place two forms with different styles in one page/post.</li>
 	<li>When it comes to set a background image and align it on the right top angle it needs a bunch of CSS knowledge to do it. Do you have it?</li>
 	<li>Styling is getting even harder when you style a form which is inside a page builder as this could stripe out all your own CSS. </li>
</ul>
Now Melanie decided to pay a part for the WOW styler development and now she is using it on all her own and her customers websites.

= You like to know how to add style in contact form 7 for FREE? =

You can use the free trial version with all features!
OR you do it like Melanie and her customers as they are using the premium version for free, because Styler Premium is free when running on a website with an active WP2LEADS Pro version.

= Now you know our story and how to use it for free =

= LET´S GET STARTED BY DOWNLOADING PLUGIN OR SEARCHING FOR “WOW STYLER” IN YOURS WP PLUGINS SECTION =

Vlad (Developer), Melanie (Online Marketer since decades) and Tobias (Plugin Innovator) created an completely new plugin with following features.

= Features =

<ul>
 	<li>Theme independent styling, changing theme will not reset style</li>
 	<li>Wide Themes, page builder and browsers compatibility</li>
 	<li>Live preview of your form style during designing it. You can see your themed form and the live form at the same time within the split view</li>
 	<li>If your theme provides CF7 styles you can additionally design your form with the styler</li>
 	<li>The Contact Form 7 style plugin is under constant improvement and support. Feel free to submit your wishes to us!</li>
 	<li>Comes for all forms with beautiful default style scheme (thanks to Vlad)</li>
 	<li>WOW Styler you just enable “load in body” to get the style active, especially in page builder/themes that would stripe out your CSS. Therefore, it works with all themes and page builders.</li>
 	<li>Style all forms from the scratch or alter the default scheme with a lot of settings (all settings listed below)</li>
</ul>

= FEATURES on LIFETIME PREMIUM OR with ACTIVE WP2LEADS PRO VERSION =

Thank you, Melanie, for the idea to style Contact Form 7 for free with active WP2LEADS license:

<ul>
 	<li>Style each form individually and attach style to any form</li>
 	<li>Align radio buttons and checkboxes</li>
 	<li>Add a different background to each form</li>
 	<li>Create as many style schemes in CF7 as needed.</li>
 	<li>Load styles in body-tag to show style when CSS is striped out by a page builder/theme. That makes it possible to style CF7 forms in nearly every place.</li>
</ul>
= Quick start ideas</strong> how to add style in contact form 7 forms =

<ul>
 	<li>Change colors of the default scheme to meet your corporate identity</li>
 	<li>Change the background of each form and save it as an different scheme like „default scheme + smiling sun“</li>
 	<li>Use the 14 days Pro trial, with all features, with a few clicks, available in plugin, via sub menu.</li>
</ul>

 	<li>With this CF7 Customizer you can easily create individual designs for your registration form or contact form with just a few clicks.</li>
 	<li>The Contact Form 7 styler works across contact form styles coming with your theme. This means you can be sure that the WOW Stylers design really works in all themes and page builders.</li>
 	<li>If you would like to have an individual contact form 7 styler that will give you a live preview for contact form 7, then the CF7 skin of this form customizer will inspire you.</li>
 	<li>Contact Form 7 style plugin is a contact form customizer that works wonderfully with other contact form 7 add-ons. Perfect collaboration between WordPress form customizer and contact form templates.</li>

 	<li>And with the premium version you can also skin all forms with the same template and you can change only background images per form, to create an eye catcher styled contact form 7 form and just save the new created style scheme with a new name like “default CI + teddy bear background” and you are done.</li>
